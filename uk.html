<p>Finance is very important sphere where companies, particularly those with assets in the US, can find support both financially and politically. If the US government makes the right policies and does not interfere in private sector matters, the financial markets can easily recover after the crisis. The only way to avoid this scenario is to give more weight to the US government; it will be much easier to persuade financial markets to believe in this country's policies.
</p>
<p>We should consider the following steps for a successful crisis and recovery program.
</p>
<p>1) Start a dialogue with the public
</p>
<p>The more public authorities support the economic recovery, the tougher it will be to overcome the next crisis. It is also in their interest that the public knows what's going on. That is why, in the past, the central government usually spends an important part of the budget on improving public morale, as well as creating a more stable economy and a good image among the people.
</p>
<p>In the case of Japan post-2009 economic growth collapsed on the economic faultlines caused by the financial crisis and related policies, and public morale plummeted.
